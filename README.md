# 🧩 Guess-the-word

A guessing game where you try to guess a 5-letter word within 15 tries.
If you reach 15 tries without guessing the word, you lose.

After each guess, each letter is shown with a color:

- **Red**: The hidden word does not contain this letter
- **Orange**: The hidden word contains this letter, but in a different position
- **Green**: The hidden word contains this letter and it is in the correct position

If you win, you can check how many guesses it took you in the history.
If you lose and are wondering what the word was, you can also find it in the history.
